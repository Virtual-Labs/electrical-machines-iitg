* Objective
  - To do the Experiment 1 of the eee02_Rotating Magnetic Field Behaviour in two coils experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/electrical-machines-iitg/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Rotating Magnetic Field Behaviour in two coils/Rotating Magnetic Field Behaviour in two coils_01_Usability_smk.org][Rotating Magnetic Field Behaviour in two coils_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Experiment 1 link 
  2. It should re-direct to the Experiment 1 page
  3. Select 3rd harmonic and don't connect one terminals of red and blue coils  to phase 1 and phase 2 respectively and connect other terminals of red and blue coils to neutral
  4. Connect the sensors to the oscilloscope, set the coil position,phase shift 1&2,select the channel , set i1,i2,f1,f2 , , set the coil position,phase shift 1&2,select the channel , set i1,i2,f1,f2 ,  and click on check connection button

* Expected result
  1. Experiment 1 page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. An error message should be displayed on the screen as to connect the wires.
