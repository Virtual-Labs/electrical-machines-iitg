  - Data : 1st harmonic and 3rd harmonic

* Objective
  - To do the Experiment 1 of the eee02_Rotating Magnetic Field Behaviour in three coils experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/electrical-machines-iitg/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Rotating Magnetic Field Behaviour in threecoils/Rotating Magnetic Field Behaviour in threecoils_01_Usability_smk.org][Rotating Magnetic Field Behaviour in threecoils_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Experiment 1 link 
  2. It should re-direct to the Experiment 1 page
  3. Select any three harmonics and connect one terminals of red ,green and blue coils  to phase 1,phase 2 and phase 3 respectively and connect other terminals of red ,green and blue coils to neutral
  4. Connect the sensors to the oscilloscope, set the coil position,phase shift 1&2,select the channel,set i1,i2,i3,f1,f2,f3 , set the coil position,phase shift 1&2,phase shift 1&3,select the channel,set i1,i2,i3,f1,f2,f3  and click on Remove all wires button

* Expected result
  1. Experiment 1 page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. The connected wires should be removed

* Review/comments
