* Objective
  - To do the Experiment 1 of the eee02_Magnetic Field Behaviour in single coil experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/virtual-electrical-machine-iitg/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Magnetic Field Behaviour in single coil/Magnetic Field Behaviour in single coil_01_Usability_smk.org][Magnetic Field Behaviour in single coil_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Experiment 1 link 
  2. It should re-direct to the Experiment 1 page
  3. Select 9th+11th+.................. harmonic and connect the terminals of the coil to power supply
  4. Connect the sensor to oscilloscope.
  5. click on Remove all wires button

* Expected result
  1. Experiment 1 page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
  3. The connected wires should be removed
