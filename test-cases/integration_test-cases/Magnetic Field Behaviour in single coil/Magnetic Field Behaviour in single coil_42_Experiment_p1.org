  - Data : 1st harmonic , 3rd harmonic,5th harmonic and 7th harmonic

* Objective
  - To do the Experiment 1 of the eee02_Magnetic Field Behaviour in single coil experiment

* Pre conditions
  - Refer to first test case [[https://github.com/Virtual-Labs/electrical-machines-iitg/blob/master/test-cases/integration_test-cases/Magnetic Field Behaviour in single coil/Magnetic Field Behaviour in single coil_01_Usability_smk.org][Magnetic Field Behaviour in single coil_01_Usability_smk.org]]

* Post conditions
  - Nil
* Test Steps
  1. Click on the Experiment 1 link 
  2. It should re-direct to the Experiment 1 page
  3. Select All harmonics and connect the terminals of the coil to power supply
  4. Connect the sensor to oscilloscope. 
  5. Click on Remove Single wire button

* Expected result
  1. Experiment 1 page should be opened
  2. Content should be present with no distortions and Junk characters
